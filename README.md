# NM10923's i3 config
My i3 config and all the scripts I use for it

# Required Packages 
- i3 (of course)
- i3blocks 
- Some sort of shell script (bash, fish, sh, zsh, etc.)

# Optional/Reccomened Packages
- nvidia-utils or an AMD alternative
- picom, but you can use your own compositor (or just not use a compositor)

# Why did you upload your shitty rice to github?
If my computer dies, I'll at least have a somewhat recent backup of my rice.

# A couple of things I still haven't gotten around to doing:
- CPU Temp, Usage, etc. in Taskbar
- Customize/Rice DMenu
- Customize/Rice ST
- Network Manager applet
